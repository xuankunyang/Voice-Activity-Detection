# To Do List

## Task 1
- ~~Adds more criteria besides **short-time-energy** and **ZCR**, such as **f0** and **frequency cluster**~~
- ~~Change the parameters-in into a **Dict**~~
- **Visualize** the curves and criteria
- ~~Get the extracting function out of the classifier~~
- ~~Add **one more linear classsifier**(maybe we can use *sklearn*)~~
- ~~Most important, split the original file into **a few files**~~
- ~~Considering adding ****windows****~~
- ~~considering ****preemphis****~~
- ~~Use our own **enframe & deframe** function~~
- ~~Use our own **stft**~~
- ~~Change the frame cause all the sampling rate is 16kHz~~
- ~~Make comparative experiment on **frame_lenth** and **frame_step**~~
- ~~Use **threshold** clf~~
- ~~Adjust the **thresholds**, analyze the classified frames first~~
- ~~Consider using different **SVM** which means the kernel type~~
- ~~Construct a logistic regression~~

## Task 2
- ~~Search for the **Methods**~~
- ~~Enframe first and classify them~~(This cause me lots of trouble)
- ~~Add the criteria **MFCC** & **FBank** &~~ **PLP**
- ~~Construct a **GMM**~~
- ~~Construct an **DNN** and put it into implements~~
- ~~Adjust the kwargs~~

- **Extracting Features!**
